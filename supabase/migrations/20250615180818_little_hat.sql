/*
  # Analytics Dashboard Performance Functions

  This migration adds database functions to optimize analytics dashboard performance by:
  
  1. Creating a stored procedure for aggregated analytics data
  2. Implementing efficient fee status calculations
  3. Adding payment method analysis
  4. Creating top defaulters calculation function
  
  These functions move heavy calculations to the database layer,
  reducing the number of queries and improving analytics dashboard rendering performance.
